The Transport Query System with MySQL-Python Connectivity is an application project designed to streamline and simplify the process of managing and querying transportation-related data.
 This system will provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with a MySQL database through a Python application. 
 It aims to improve the efficiency of handling transportation data, such as routes, schedules, and vehicle information,
 while also enabling users to retrieve relevant information quickly and accurately..
 This project consists of 2 separate databases, one for Bus Transport and the other for Train Transport. Both the databases contain 2 tables which are related to each other.
 Using the interface user can Add data, Display data, Search data, Delete data, Update data.
 This project addresses the need for better transportation data management, benefiting both transportation authorities and the general public.
